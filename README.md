# ColoredBoard: A Scriabin-Inspired Color-Music Experience

![ColoredBoard Screenshot](Screenshot.png) 

An interactive web piano that visualizes Alexander Scriabin's color-note associations through dynamic background gradients. Explore the controversial but fascinating relationship between music and color as envisioned by the Russian composer.

## Key Features

- **Synesthetic Interface**: Each piano key triggers its corresponding Scriabin-associated color
- **Dynamic Gradients**: Multiple notes create blended color transitions in playing order
- **Historical Implementation**: Faithful recreation of Scriabin's clavier à lumières concept
- **Keyboard Interaction**: Play via keyboard (PC)
- **Audio-Visual Synthesis**: Integrated piano sounds with real-time color feedback

## Installation & Usage

- Clone repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dmukherjeetextiles/metamusics.git
- Open index.html in a web browser

- Play using: Computer keyboard (see key labels)

## About Scriabin's Color Theory
This project interprets Alexander Scriabin's controversial color-music system from his unfinished work Mysterium and the tone poem Prometheus: The Poem of Fire. While modern scholars debate whether Scriabin had true synesthesia, his color associations reflect:

- Theosophical spiritual concepts

- Emotional resonance theories

- Chromatic harmonic relationships

- Proposed "total artwork" (Gesamtkunstwerk) ideals

- The color organ (clavier à lumières) implementation here follows Scriabin's 1911 mappings documented by musicologist Leonid Sabaneyev.
